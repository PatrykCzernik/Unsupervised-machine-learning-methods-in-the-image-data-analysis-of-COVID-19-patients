In this work, unsupervised machine learning methods were used for analysis of chest X-rays showing the changes caused by Covid-19. Efforts were made to prove that testing the homogeneity of the sample is important because there are often many subgroups in the data. First, a network was trained about architecture Pix2pix for lung segmentation from radiographs. In the next stage, the radiomic features were counted and used as features for unsupervised methods machine learning such as K-means and DBSCAN. A linear dimension reduction with PCA (Principal component analysis) in the next one step, a non-linear reduction of the dimensionality of UMAP data (Uniform Mani fold Approximation and Projection). The groups of healthy and sick people were analyzed separately.
